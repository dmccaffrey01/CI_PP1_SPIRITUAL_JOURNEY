            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>You’ve probably heard the buzzwords meditation and mindfulness before especially if you’re into self help/development or heard some doctor give health advice about the many benefits of meditation but what actually is it and why do it in the first place? Here I will go over the basics but I will go beyond that and lay out a whole new world of spirituality that doesn’t come with religious dogma that can completely transform your life.</p>

        <div id="meditation-desc" class="card">
            <h2>What is meditation?</h2>
            <p>Meditation is a mental practice that trains your awareness and helps clear the mind. Learning to meditate is a skill, like any other skill it takes consistent practice and think of it like working out or doing exercise for your mind.</p>

        <div id="mindulness-desc" class="card">
            <h2>What is mindfulness?</h2>
            <p>Mindfulness is a word with no clear definition but basically it is the ability to be present in the here and now no matter what you're doing.</p>

            <h2>Why Meditate?</h2>
            <p>I’ll go over the normal health benefits of meditation that can improve your life, but meditation can go way beyond these simple improvements and can change your complete perspective and paradigm of the world.</p>

            <h2>Stress and anxiety</h2>

                    Enlightenment is translated from words in Buddhism and Hinduism, and simply put it is a deep realisation into true self. It is the end of false self, the ego, the “I” that thinks it is at the centre of the universe vanishes and you are left with truth. It is the realisation that you are the entire universe and there never was a separate self. This realisation ends all suffering as what causes suffering is identification with thought, also known as ego. The small self is transcended by the big Self, and you experience total unification with the entire universe also known as non-duality.You realise that there was never any doer, the self completely dissolves, in fact you realise that there was never anyone to awaken in the first place.

                    This all might seem completely delusional and false especially if you are very materialistically minded like most of us are but if you are open-minded enough to this possibility it can be the most life transforming thing. We are so identified with our thoughts that we have no idea what this experience would be like and shrug it off as it might not make logical sense in our heads. But we have all experienced glimpses of this world, have you ever been so immersed into an activity that time seems to stop, this is also known as flow state and many athletes and musicians know exactly what I’m talking about. You become so immersed that the self, the thinker inside the head dissolves and it seems like some higher power takes over. Now imagine that but you experience it every moment and a thousand times better. The end of thought and end of self is the end of suffering, you are at peace, total bliss, heaven on earth.

                    This may sound amazing, heaven, nirvana, total bliss but it should sound scary, because I’m saying the self ends.  Another way of thinking about it is that you die and are reborn before you actually die, you psychologically die before your physically body dies. Enlightenment is no joke, it is the search for truth. It's not something to see as a fun little hobby, it will completely change your life and it may not always be a positive experience. It is the search for truth at all costs. Many of us think we want truth but when it comes at such huge costs like the annihilation of self it may not be the case that we like what we find. The search for truth is no small task, many of us believe that truth is something that many of us know, but do you? Have you ever asked what you know? What is true? If you really ask that question you’ll find it quite empty but don’t just believe me see for yourself. Things you might think are fundamentally true can be very easily deconstructed. This deconstruction is very useful along the path of awakening and I will go into more detail in the techniques section.

                    Enlightenment is the waking up from the dream that everyone calls reality, but many of us don’t want to wake up, we want to dream that we have woken up and this is why there are so many traps in the spiritual journey. It is very easy to fool yourself. Actually waking up can be brutal and unsafe which is why people would rather dream that they have woken up.

                    Enlightenment is also quite paradoxical, or it is hard to describe using logical language because when you awaken you realise there was never anyone to awaken and that in the end of your search you realise that this insight has always been here in the now. Listening to this you might think that “well then everyone is enlightened and why bother pursuing this”, my response would be to not burn the ship before you crossed the water. Enlightenment is more about the journey than the destination. Even though you end up in the same destination you gained valuable insight which can be more rewarding than any pleasure life has to offer
                    Even though I am sort of selling you the idea of total bliss after enlightenment, this is also false. You will experience bliss along the path but if you are expecting to live there constantly like many spiritual teachings preach, they are selling you BS. Experiences of no self and complete unity with everything are peak experiences but they give you valuable insight into your own nature. Enlightenment is the search for truth, your own truth, not some truth someone has told you, and you shouldn’t expect that you live in complete bliss all the time throughout the journey. It requires a lot of work and the work only really begins once you have caught the glimpse of true nature. Integrating Truth back into the world of form and living without suffering is the hard part.

                    So if you're not put off by the idea you might be wondering how do I pursue this or where do I start, and this is where the tool of meditation comes in. Various techniques like do nothing meditation and self enquiry with a lot of work also, you can achieve awakening. I will lay out various <a href="#">techniques</a>, a <a href="#">roadmap</a> for the spiritual path and some good <a href="#">resources</a> to help you along the way.

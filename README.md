## Design

### Design Selection
The website was designed to have a feeling of the open sky, with lots of space being calm and pleasent to look at like a calm mind after meditation.

### Colour
The colour scheme is a relaxing gray and blue to represent the sky and clouds which resembles the activity of our minds. I choose the colour scheme and tested the contrast using WebAIM.

### Fonts
Google Fonts were used throughout the whole page.
Playfair Display was used for h1 and h2 headings including the logo with sans-serif as a fallback.
Source-Sans-Pro was used for the body with sans-serif as a fallback.

### Structure
The page is strucutred in a well known, recognizable, user friendly, and easy to learn way. When reaching the website the user sees the company logo on the left and a navigation menu button on the right.
The website has 4 seperate pages and 1 404 error page rerouting the user back to the home page.

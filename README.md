## Design

### Design Selection
The website was designed to have a feeling of the open sky, with lots of space being calm and pleasent to look at like a calm mind after meditation.

### Colour
The colour scheme is a relaxing gray and blue to represent the sky and clouds which resembles the activity of our minds. I choose the colour scheme and tested the contrast using WebAIM.

![Colour Scheme](docs/colour-scheme.jpg)

### Fonts
Google Fonts were used throughout the whole page.
Playfair Display was used for h1 and h2 headings including the logo with sans-serif as a fallback.
Source-Sans-Pro was used for the body with sans-serif as a fallback.

### Structure
The page is strucutred in a well known, recognizable, user friendly, and easy to learn way. When reaching the website the user sees the company logo on the left and a navigation menu button on the right.
The website has 4 seperate pages and 1 404 error page rerouting the user back to the home page.
- Home page with welcome hero image, introduction, definitions, benefits, and call to actions to advance further on the website
- About us page describing our mission, a newsletter subscription modal and a contact section which includes email, socials and location
- Techniques & Guide page with useful practice information, subscription modal, and call to actions
- Resources page with book and app recommendations, retreats info, maps info, and youtube links

All the pages mostly had the same issues

There was no errors in all the pages

The alerts are high on all pages but most of them are to do with links which I had to use CSS tricks to get around, some of them are possible heading alerts aswell
